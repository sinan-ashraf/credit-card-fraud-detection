# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains a complete Jupyter Notebook (`credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb`) demonstrating how to detect credit card fraud using machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Overview

Credit card fraud detection is crucial for financial security. This notebook walks through an end-to-end project using the **Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset**. It covers:

- 📂 Data loading and exploration  
- 📊 Dealing with class imbalance  
- 🏗️ Building preprocessing pipelines  
- 🔧 Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV  
- 🚀 Model training (Logistic Regression)  
- 🧪 Model evaluation with precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC  
- 🔮 Making predictions on new transactions  

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **pandas** for data handling  
- **scikit-learn** for ML pipelines, modeling, and evaluation  
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for data visualization  

## 📊 Results
We built a robust pipeline and tuned it to handle the imbalanced dataset, achieving a good balance between precision and recall for detecting fraudulent transactions.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sinan-ashraf/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
    ```
2. Open the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb
    ```
3. Run each cell to see the full workflow.

## 💡 Key Takeaways
✅ Pipelines help prevent data leakage  
✅ Class weights handle class imbalance  
✅ GridSearchCV helps find the best model settings  
✅ Visualization makes model performance clearer
